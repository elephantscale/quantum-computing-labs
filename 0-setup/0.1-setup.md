### Step 1) Install Anaconda with the GUI installer

* Download the Anaconda installer for your operating system from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads). We recommend using the graphical installer.
* Last install step: say **"yes"** to initializing Conda



* If it still cannot recognize python, you can try this:

```shell
sudo apt install python-is-python3
```
