### Step 1) Install Anaconda with the GUI installer

* Download the Anaconda installer for your operating system from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual#Downloads). We recommend using the graphical installer.
* Last install step: say **"yes"** to initializing Conda

### Step 2) Verify

* Start another terminal
```shell
python
```
* You should see the version of python
* CTRL-d to exit


* If it still cannot recognize python, you can try this:

```shell
sudo apt install python-is-python3
```
